A presentation for the Engineering part IA lego project

Tool used
---------

* [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/) ([github](http://github.com/imakewebthings/deck.js))
* [briGL](http://www.lugato.net/brigl/index.html) ([bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/msx80/brigl)) - Modified to improve step handing. Ideally, this should be done in a more planned manner so that it can be merged upstream
* [Mathbox](https://github.com/unconed/MathBox.js/)

Big thanks to [@unconed](https://github.com/unconed) for the inspiration to use the web to present, and his [presentations](https://github.com/unconed/fullfrontal) for a starting point.
